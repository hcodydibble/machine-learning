# Machine Learning

This is the start of attempting to learn machine learning. Hopefully it goes ok.
## Data Analysist 

So far it isn't going ok. The data set worked with hasn't been very cooperative in me learning anything but I'm hopeful that it will work at some point.

[This](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) is the data set used (The Boston Housing Dataset). In order to attempt to use it I imported it into a Jupyter Notebook, and found out how to actually access the given data. After doing that I found that inside the data there was information on

- CRIM     – per capita crime rate by town
- ZN     – proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft
- INDUS     – proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS     – Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; else 0)
- NOX     – nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM     – average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE     – proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS     – weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- RAD     – index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX     – full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO     – pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B     – 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT     – % lower status of the population

## Imperfect Data

I am hopeful. I decided to go with [Seattle City Parks with Park Features](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Parks-and-Park-Features/rhf2-u5fm) because it seemed like an easier place to start and because knowing what parks have what features is always useful information and could be helpful in the future.
